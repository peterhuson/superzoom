# Super Zoom

This project will perform super resolution up-sampling on images we provide. Super resolution up-sampling is performed by taking a low-resolution image as input, and using a neural network or heuristic model to output a higher resolution image with more details than the initial image. This can be accomplished through many different waysâ€”--which we aim to explore in this project. We would like to explore where current state-of-the art algorithms and models perform well and where they perform poorly, then improve on the areas that need work. 

# Guiding Questions
1. What types of images does it perform well/poorly on?
2. What does it seem to pick up on?
3. How well does it generalize to other datasets?
    1. Other types of images (indoors, medical images, greyscale)?
4. What happens if we put in an already full resolution image?
5. Portrait mode?
6. Consistency?
