# Super Zoom

This project will perform super resolution up-sampling on images we provide. Super resolution up-sampling is performed by taking a low-resolution image as input, and using a neural network or heuristic model to output a higher resolution image with more details than the initial image. This can be accomplished through many different waysâ€”--which we aim to explore in this project. We would like to explore where current state-of-the art algorithms and models perform well and where they perform poorly, then improve on the areas that need work.
